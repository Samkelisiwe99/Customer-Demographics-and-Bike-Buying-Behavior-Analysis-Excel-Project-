## 🔍 Key Insights
1. **Marital Status and Income:**  
   Married individuals earn higher average incomes than single individuals, resulting in greater purchasing power. Married people (both male and female) are more likely to buy bikes.

2. **Gender and Purchasing Power:**  
   Among females, single women tend to have lower income and purchasing power, leading to fewer bike purchases compared to married women.

3. **Car Ownership and Bike Purchases:**  
   - People with **no cars** purchase the fewest bikes — likely due to lower income levels.  
   - Those with **one car** are the most likely to purchase a bike.  
   - Individuals with **multiple cars** are less interested in buying bikes, possibly due to higher car dependency.

4. **Education Level:**  
   Customers with **lower educational qualifications (e.g., high school diploma)** tend to purchase more bikes than those with higher degrees.

5. **Age Group:**  
   - **Middle-aged (30–49)** and **older (50+)** individuals are the main bike buyers.  
   - **Younger customers (<30)** are the least likely to purchase bikes.

6. **Commute Distance:**  
   People who live **closer to work** are more likely to purchase bikes, while those with **longer commutes** are less likely.
